            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, and welcome to my devolopment portfolio! As you see above, my name is Zackary Murphy. I am studying Full-Stack Development through Codecademy and hope to one day be a professional developer. I have always been fascinated by figuring out how things work, breaking things apart and putting them back together again. Programming has given me the perfect way to build that interest into a career, and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for me! Below are a list of the skills and languages I have learned so far. You will also find a link above to a list of my completed projects, most of which you can find and access yourself via my GitHub page. Please check them out, and maybe throw me a little feedback if you are so inclined! I am always eager to find out more ways that I can improve my skills and programs. In my personal life I'm a social butterfly who loves to spend time with friends, whether that be in person or online. I enjoy games of all varieties, but especially role-playing games. I am also an avid animal lover, with several pets: currently a <a href="#" id="dog">dog</a>, a snake, a turtle, and a chinchilla. Regardless of what brought you here, thanks for taking the time to get to know me a bit!</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>P.S.<br>I've added a few easter eggs throughout my portfolio to show off some of the skills I have learned. Currently there are a total of 3 unique interactions. Happy hunting!</p>
